# Java-Combat-System---Dungeon-Monster-Arena
Built a Java turn-based monster combat system using OOP with inheritance, abstract classes, and interfaces. Added cloning, poison effects, random weapon choice, and stat-based attacks across subclasses. Designed a modular structure for flexible monster behavior, ranking, and dungeon battles.
